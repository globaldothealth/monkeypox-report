    Bug in QC script that led to script not running for a day. The lack of
    updates caused file not to be updated, and this resulted in no changes
    observed. Bug was fixed in 19562faefd1155a691f3cf01e7500f5f3a84d110, so
    picking the generated file after that as today's file.

  info: >
    Prior to this report, number of travel history cases and percentage
    male calculation incorrectly used all cases, instead of only confirmed.
    Archived reports will be updated soon.
2022-07-25:
  info: >
    Reporting now includes all cases, including from endemic countries.
    Choropleth and case count graph are now interactive. Genomic data
    is filtered using clade membership instead of filtering by
    genomes after May 2022.

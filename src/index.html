<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> The Monkeypox 2022 outbreak has to date been detected in {{ n_countries }}
countries and caused at least {{ n_confirmed }} confirmed and {{ n_suspected }}
suspected cases (as of
{{ date }}; <strong>Figure 1A</strong>). Since {{ yesterday }}, {{ n_diff_confirmed }}
new confirmed cases have
been reported{{ text_diff_countries }} (<strong>Figure 1B</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Table 1</strong>: Number of confirmed cases by country (highest
    to lowest) and percentage change since last week.</p>

<p>Of the {{ n_confirmed }} number of confirmed cases, {{ n_travel_history
    }} reported travel history. For {{ n_unknown_travel_history }} cases, travel
    history location was unknown.</p>

<p> The mean delay between confirmation and entry of suspected
    case was {{ mean_delay_suspected_confirmed }} days
    (median {{ median_delay_suspected_confirmed }} days) and varied by country
    (n = {{ n_suspected_confirmed }} total number of
    cases where the dates of suspected and confirmed was known; <strong>Figure 2</strong>).
    Most countries do not report suspected cases.</p>

<p>Genomic data is being reported via multiple open source repositories.
    The (combined) number of genomic sequences of the current outbreak is
    {{ n_genomes }}. The country with the highest number of genomic
    sequences reported is {{ country_with_most_genomes }}. A comparison
    between the number of genomes and number of confirmed cases is below
(<strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>

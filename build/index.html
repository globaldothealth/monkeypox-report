<p><strong>Table 1</strong>: Number of confirmed cases by country (highest
    to lowest) and percentage change since last week.</p>

<p>Of the 1313 number of confirmed cases, 92 reported travel history. For  travel
    history location was unknown.</p>

<p> The mean delay between confirmation and entry of suspected
    case was 4 (median 3.96) and varied by country (n = XX total number of
    cases were the dates of suspected and confirmed was known; Figure 2).
    Most countries do not report suspected cases.</p>
